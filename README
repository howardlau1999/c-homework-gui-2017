1. install python3 first (not python2)
                 ^python 3.5.2 tested

2. install pip (search how to install it yourself)
   * no need to install if python version >= 3.4 but upgrade is needed (optional)

3. run "pip -V" and "python -V" to check pip version and python version, make sure they both satisfy python >= 3.4
   * on Ubuntu there usually exist both python2 and python3
   * in this case, you will need to run "pip3 ..." and "python3 ..." to replace all the commands below

4. cd into the gui directory and run "pip install -r requirement.txt" and wait
   (if any error occured please re-run the command)
   * when "failed to create process" appears, run "python -m pip install -r requirement.txt" instead
   * don't forget to run pip3 and python3 on Ubuntu!

5. double-click on "gui.pyw" to run the program
   * or run "python3 gui.pyw" on Ubuntu

6. remember to setup your username and password first (on the top-left corner of the menu bar)
   * on Ubuntu the menu bar is on the top of the screen

any suggestions are warmly welcomed!

you may modify the code yourself and share if you like!

p.s:

sometimes the program fails to run on Ubuntu, maybe it would say that "...module PyQt5.Qsci is not found"

contact me in this case.
